        <p> <strong>Here is a list with my favorite movies: </strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interstellar - This movie is too good. It is popular for a reason.</li>
            <li>Jurassic Park - The original 3 movies are the best. I don't like the new ones.</li>
            <li>Pride and Prejudice - All I have to say is that it is a work of art. </li>
            <li>Dead Poets Society - Carpe diem. </li>
            <li>To all the boys I've loved before - If you don't like this movie you're weird. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Here is a ranking of my favorite music artists: </strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Tame Impala - Every song is perfect. </li>
            <li> Joji - Just because pixelated kisses is the best song ever. </li>
            <li> Glaive and Ericdoa are tied - Glaive's new album is so good. They're amazing alone and crazy good when they collab. </li>
            <li> SZA - She's so talented. I love her music. </li>
        </ol>
